## 👋 Hi, I'm Angel

Welcome to my little corner of the internet, and thank you for stopping by. If you’ve found your way to this page, I hope you’re curious to learn a bit more about the story behind this site.

My name is Shing Hui, and I created this website in the winter of 2025 as a creative outlet for my love of travel, photography, and personal reflections. I realized that my personal social media accounts weren’t giving me the space or reach I wanted—especially when it came to the meaningful conversations and touching stories I encountered during my travels. So I decided to create a more intentional platform, and that’s how Glowing Space was born. 

I didn’t travel very far during my childhood, but I’m grateful that my family brought me to several ASEAN countries… Looking back at those albums always fills me with warmth, and I think that’s how photography slowly became one of my passions.

During my university life in Tainan, Taiwan, I grew up in many ways. To my surprise, I was given an exchange placement in Kraków, Poland. That long European journey truly changed my life. I always kept my camera with me to document every moment.

Living in Kraków during my exchange at Jagiellonian University gave me the travel bug. With airports and transport links right at my doorstep, I had every reason to explore. In just six months, I traveled to 17 countries.

In many ways, this site serves as my digital journal, and I’m grateful to have a space to share all the ups and downs. 

Feel free to explore—there are already plenty of destinations here, with more on the way.

So that’s a little about me. I hope you enjoy my photographs and stories.
