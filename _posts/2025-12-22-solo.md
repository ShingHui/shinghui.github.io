> *First-time solo traveler? Start here.*

During my exchange period, I met many young women traveling solo—some even living abroad entirely on their own.

My aim in writing this is to share one simple belief: once you’ve bravely decided to travel, the outcome matters less than how you feel along the way.

What truly matters is whether your mind and body can find joy throughout the experience.
And whether your surroundings allow you to return safely—free from personal security concerns.

> 💬 **If this is your first solo trip and you’re feeling nervous, you’re not weak—you’re human.**

Every woman I met on my travels was moving from one destination to the next, entirely alone.
In each other’s eyes, there was only admiration and quiet respect for our shared courage.
And yet—even with an independent upbringing—moments of vulnerability still surfaced for me.
I allowed myself to feel them.
Not every solo journey looks like what we see on screens or social media.

## 📱 A Gentle Reality Check

People rarely show vulnerability online — not because it doesn’t exist, but because some emotions need time to be processed privately. Part of solo travel is learning how to sit with discomfort, uncertainty, and silence. And part of it is discovering that you’re capable of far more than you imagined.

Each independent journey shapes you differently.
Along the way, you build confidence—and learn how to navigate emotions and unexpected challenges.

## ❓ Is Solo Travel Lonely?

Let’s be honest.

**Traveling solo isn’t easy—at all.**

• It can be deeply empowering and life-changing <br>
• It can also feel lonely, especially when you’re sick, tired, or emotionally low <br>
• And sometimes, both feelings exist at the same time <br>

Most people don’t talk about this openly.
Not because they’re pretending—but because they’re still processing.

But here’s what I’ve learned:

> 🌱 **Loneliness doesn’t mean you’re failing. It means you’re growing.**
<br> Every solo traveler I’ve met has grown stronger by learning how to be alone. Yet not a single one would say it was all sunshine and roses.There will always be moments that push you outside your comfort zone.

## 📸 How to Get Epic Solo Travel Photos

We live in the age of social media, and everyone wants those perfect solo travel photos and videos to document their adventures and share their journeys.

If you have particularly high standards for your photos, I’d strongly recommend bringing a tripod—especially if you’re traveling to more remote places. Using a tripod with a self-timer on your camera or phone can make a huge difference.

That said, I often simply ask someone to take my photo—usually other girls—or I meet fellow solo travelers and we help each other take pictures.

### A Memory from Paris: Arc de Triomphe

I still remember one moment clearly in Paris.

I randomly asked an elderly couple—grandparents visiting from China—to take photos of me at the Arc de Triomphe. I wasn’t expecting professional photography skills at all. I just wanted a simple memory: me, and the Arc de Triomphe.

To my surprise, they captured one of the cutest photos I’ve ever had.

We then started chatting. I helped take photos of them, and they took photos of me. It felt a bit like they were photographing their granddaughter—and somehow, the photos turned out unexpectedly good.

### 🤍 Girl Helps Girl: Another Paris Moment

There was another sweet memory in Paris — one that reminded me how kind solo travel can be.

I met a girl who had traveled from very far away. We crossed Pont de Bir-Hakeim together, and I was taking selfies with the Eiffel Tower in the background. She walked up to me and asked, “Do you want me to take some photos for you?”

I said, “Sure—thank you!”

Those photos became some of the most iconic, and the only—good pictures I got there.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: left ; align-items: flex-start; gap:8px">

    <img src="/assets/img/2025/solo/IMG_3670.jpeg" style="height: 300px; width: auto; object-fit: cover;">
</div>

We chatted for a while, and I found out during our conversation that she was a professional photographer. We shared some funny stories from our journeys. She took several photos for me, but in the end, I chose not to exchange contact details. I believe some memories are best left within the story itself.

We savored the moment, wished each other well, and continued on our own paths. There’s no need to exchange contact details with every kindred spirit we meet. 

>  *Sometimes, a brief encounter that warms the heart is more than enough.*

In that moment, we were simply happy.

## 🛟 Safety Quick Guide

### Lifesaver: Travel Insurance & SIM / eSIM

Always have internet access—it’s essential when traveling solo.

An **eSIM** is a digital SIM that works just like a physical one, allowing you to activate a mobile plan for calls, texts, and internet. Unlike physical SIM cards, eSIMs are built into your device and only require activation. There’s no need to order or wait for a physical card to arrive, which makes it especially convenient when traveling.

Buying **travel insurance is a must**. Don’t assume that being young means you can skip it. Insurance offers comfort and reassurance when something unexpected happens.
If you get sick or injured, you can access medical care without facing overwhelming bills. If your luggage gets lost or your flight is delayed, you’ll also be able to make a claim.

### Eating Alone

> *People don’t care as much as you think they do*

One downside of eating alone is that you can’t order as much food, you can’t share dishes, and—honestly—you don’t always have a big enough stomach.
But the upside is being fully present with your meal. Eating alone becomes a moment of "me" time, where you can slow down and truly enjoy the experience.

---

### Staying Safe

The most important rule: **trust your instincts and your gut**

If something doesn’t feel safe, don’t do it—or try to find someone to do it with. Apps and platforms like [Bumble](https://bumble.com/en-us/bff), [TravelLadies](https://travelladies.app/), or [Hostelworld](https://www.hostelworld.com/?source=ppc_gooads_brand_dsk_search_brd_en_row&network=g&campaign_id=13461949562&adgroup_id=130259537424&criteria_id=kwd-137381844&creative_id=594756953728&location_physical_id=1029496&location_interest_id=&adposition=&uniqueclickID=13934523597972709410&sub_keyword=hostelworld&sub_ad=e&sub_publisher=ADW&gclsrc=aw.ds&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=13461949562&gbraid=0AAAAAD9QXQbTj9mkh-k-sJhQBlNO1c1BZ&gclid=CjwKCAiAmKnKBhBrEiwAaqAnZwz4swnkyuOtLi66Om8yfn8vyIp1_4ZMa8amUuO5gm9ui85ZJfGXahoCWJAQAvD_BwE) chats can be helpful, but always stay cautious around strangers.

Don’t beat yourself up for not being “adventurous enough.” You’re already adventurous just by traveling solo. Being frugal is a virtue, but if spending a little more makes you feel safer, it’s worth it. You are never obligated to share personal information with strangers.

#### **Dress & Belongings**

Dress appropriately and avoid flashy jewelry or designer bags. Carry some cash in the local currency—but not too much.

In most European cities, Apple Pay and Wise are widely accepted. If you’re visiting smaller towns or suburban areas, carrying some cash is still useful.

In China, WeChat Pay, Alipay, and Wise are commonly accepted—even for public transport and daily transactions.

Always carry a **power bank** to keep your phone charged. Getting lost with a dead phone is something you want to avoid at all costs.

If you plan to go out at night, plan your route home in advance. Know how you’ll get back, and avoid heavy drinking—especially when you’re far from your accommodation.

In touristy cities, be aware of friendly scammers. They may start small talk, offer you a “gift,” and then ask for money. Never take the gift. Resist the urge to be polite—no matter what story they tell.

### Making Friends

I’m naturally extroverted, so meeting new people while traveling doesn’t overwhelm me.
If you’re more introverted and preparing for your first solo trip, hostels, especially shared kitchens—are a great place to start. You can also join platforms like the Facebook group *[Host A Sister](https://www.facebook.com/share/g/1FtPiq9Yny/)*, sign up for group tours, or join organized activities.

I’ve been part of *Host A Sister* since October 2024. Through the group, I met wonderful women in Vienna and Berlin. I’ve even found free accommodation there, and in return, I cooked homemade meals or brought souvenirs from my home country.

Host A Sister is a safe and supportive community centered on womanhood. It welcomes women, as well as non-binary and gender-fluid individuals who resonate with womanhood. The goal is to uplift, support, and empower one another in a respectful and inclusive environment.

> Through Host A Sister, you can:
 > - Find free accommodation with a local sister
 > - Meet up with locals or fellow travelers
 > - Host travelers in your hometown
 > - Offer companionship to someone traveling alone
 > - Find a female travel buddy
 > - Organize meetups or events while traveling

It’s okay to spend time alone—but remember, no one stays alone forever. Traveling gives us rare chances to meet people who are different from us. Sometimes, **1 + 1 is greater than 2**, and stepping outside your comfort zone leads to the best moments.

## ✨ A Final Note

I always find joy in traveling solo <br>
Not because it’s easy—but because it teaches me things no book ever could <br>
The people I’ve met have left me with cherished memories,<br>
preserving the vibrant spirit of my youth at twenty-three and twenty-four.<br>

Including how to sit with my emotions<br>
How to trust myself<br>
And how to build a life I genuinely enjoy living<br>
It has its challenges—but it also has its quiet, powerful rewards.<br>


If you choose solo travel, embrace it fully.<br>
Make it work *for you*.<br>

That’s often how we fall in love—not just with travel—but with the life we create along the way.
