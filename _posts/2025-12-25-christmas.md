🎄 It’s almost that time of the year again! <br>

In this post, you’ll discover what the festive season looks like in Poland, a country in Central–Eastern Europe.

>✨ Side note: I really love Kraków.<br>
  *Poland is, in my opinion, one of the most underrated countries in Europe. If you’re looking for a Christmas destination that won’t drain your wallet, skip France or Austria and head straight to Poland.*

## 🇵🇱 Christmas Traditions in Poland (Just a lil intro)

Christmas is incredibly important in Poland—it’s one of the most significant events of the year.

In Polish, Christmas is called **Boże Narodzenie**, which literally means *“God’s Birth.”* It holds deep religious meaning, as over 90% of Poland’s population identifies as Catholic.

On **Christmas Eve**, there’s a beautiful tradition:
People wait until **the first star appears in the sky** before eating dinner.

I also learned from my Polish friends that families traditionally prepare **12 dishes** on Christmas Eve, symbolizing the **Twelve Apostles**.

## 🎄 Best Christmas Markets in Poland (My Ranking)

I’ve visited three Christmas markets in Poland. *Based on my experience*, here’s my personal ranking:

| City | Ranking | 
| ---- | ------- |
| Wrocław | 1 |
| Kraków | 2 |
| Poznań | 3 |

### Wrocław Christmas Market 

> It was one of my favourite Christmas Market that I had gone to

Wrocław’s stunning Market Square transforms into a festive wonderland from November through December. The market stretches across multiple locations—four main areas plus smaller parks—making it feel spacious and lively rather than crowded.

The decorations are bold, playful, and immersive. [Wrocław](https://www.wroclawguide.com/en/) truly surprised me (as it always does).

---

### Kraków Christmas Market – Rynek Główny

Kraków’s Christmas market is set in Rynek Główny, one of the largest medieval squares in Europe.

Surrounded by historic architecture and the twin towers of **[St. Mary’s Basilica](https://mariacki.com/en/)**, the atmosphere is undeniably magical. However, there’s *only one main market area*, and since the stalls occupy just part of the square, it can feel more cramped and crowded—especially during peak hours.

Still, wandering the Old Town under twinkling lights is an experience not to be missed.

### Poznań Christmas Market (Family-Friendly)
[Poznań’s](https://visitpoznan.pl/en) Christmas market is spread across three locations, making it ideal for families.

It features:

* Kid-friendly rides and activities
* Small game booths
* Colourful decorations
* A lively, cheerful atmosphere in the Old Town Square
* It’s vibrant, playful, and especially enjoyable if you’re traveling with children

## 🎭 Overall Impression

If you’re searching for the **“WOW factor”** — huge decorations, extravagant lighting, and Instagram-perfect setups like those in Austria or Berlin—you might find Polish Christmas markets more understated.

However, that’s exactly their charm.

Poland offers some of *the least commercialized* Christmas markets I’ve experienced. Instead of excess, you’ll find a cozy, authentic, and traditional atmosphere—almost fairy-tale-like. Think wooden stalls, folk performances, live choirs, Polish dances, and a warmth that feels genuinely festive rather than staged.

## 🔥 MUST EAT at Polish Christmas Markets

### 🧀 Oscypek (Smoked Sheep Cheese) — NON-NEGOTIABLE 

This is hands down one of the best things you can eat at a Christmas market.

**Oscypek** is a traditional smoked sheep’s cheese from the Podhale region of Poland’s Tatra Mountains, officially protected by the EU under PDO status. It’s typically grilled until golden and served with a topping of cranberry jam.

> I’m not exaggerating when I say: **this is one of the best cheeses I’ve ever had in my life.**

---

### 🌭 Grilled Meats & Polish Sausages

Classic, hearty, and perfect for winter. I went straight for the Polish sausages—and they didn’t disappoint.

---

### 🥟 Pierogi

Pierogi are a staple of Polish cuisine, enjoyed daily by locals. They come in both sweet and savory versions.

At Christmas markets, you’ll find unique fillings like:

- Duck & apricot
- Pulled beef
- Vegetable mixes (meat-free,"veggie-lover")

That said, pierogi shops are everywhere in city centers, so you don’t have to eat them at the market—but if you want to, just go for it.

---

## 🌿 Souvenirs to Consider

### Amber

Poland is famous for amber, especially along the Baltic coast. The largest number of amber shops is found in **Gdańsk**.

If possible, wait to buy amber there. I wouldn’t recommend purchasing it in Kraków unless you’re short on time or won’t be visiting **Gdańsk** or **Warsaw**.

---

### 🍸 Vodka

Vodka plays a big role in Polish culture—it’s often a symbol of hospitality and friendship.

If a Polish person offers to treat you to a drink, it’s considered polite to accept. Popular varieties include:

- Żubrówka (bison grass vodka)
- Chocolate vodka by Wedel, a legendary Polish chocolate brand

When in Poland, there’s really no excuse not to sample their vodkas and liqueurs. *PLS TRY IT*

---

### 🍷 Mulled Wine 

If you don’t care about collecting novelty mugs, you can get mulled wine from bars around the Market Square.

Look for:
- “Grzane Wino”
- “Grzaniec”

In Kraków, you won’t find the famous shoe-shaped mugs (those are in Wrocław).
Poznań usually serves mulled wine in traditional glass mugs.

Prices typically range from **12–30 PLN**, depending on the city and container. Sometimes it’s served in paper to-go cups—which can be a bit of a letdown, but still warming on a cold night.
