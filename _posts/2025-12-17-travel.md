## ✈️ Turning Travel Ideas into Real Trips

Last year, I spent countless hours poring over travel booking sites — searching for the best flight deals, affordable accommodation, safe and local food options, and creating my own tailor-made itineraries, especially when it came to local transportation tips.

I usually follow a loose set of steps that help turn a vague travel idea into a fun trip — most of them long and solo journeys. However, I don’t always make long packing lists or detailed plans for every destination. I enjoy leaving room for unexpected moments, people, and places.

I wrote this guide with both long-term and short-term travelers in mind. I also share specific travel tips for women traveling solo, especially in Europe and China.

## 🌍 Before We Start

This was my first time traveling to Europe. As an exchange student studying in Poland, I wanted to live life to the fullest—knowing how powerful a student visa can be, and that age can sometimes limit opportunities later on.

I was excited to explore as much of Europe as I could within six months. I prefer to create tailor-made itineraries, usually starting by listing the countries I want to visit (preferably nearby or well-connected) and deciding how many days to spend in each.

> **In short:** flexibility first, structure second.

## ✈️ Finding Cheap Flights (The Most Important Part)

Finding affordable flights is always my first step.

### Platforms I Use Most

-  **[Skyscanner](https://www.skyscanner.com.my/)** — fast comparisons across multiple booking sites  
-  **[Google Flights](https://www.google.com/travel/flights)** — excellent for flexible dates and price tracking  
-  **[Trip.com](https://my.trip.com/?locale=en-my)** — especially useful when traveling in China

I usually compare prices across these platforms before making a decision.

---

### 💡 Tip: Use Incognito Mode When Searching for Flights

Try using an incognito browser whenever you casually feel like browsing or searching for flights—it can sometimes help you spot cheaper fares.

I’ve noticed that Skyscanner often shows flights that turn out to be cheaper on other booking sites. That said, I still check airline websites directly from time to time, as they sometimes offer exclusive coupons, ongoing discounts, or membership reward points.

## 🕒 When (and When Not) to Book Flights Early

I’ll be honest—I’m usually not someone who books flights very early. One reason is that Europe offers plenty of alternative transportation options, such as trains and buses.

However, for short stays in the EU, most travelers will need to apply for a **Schengen visa**, which usually requires a confirmed return flight. In those cases, I book my flight first and then proceed with the visa application.

### ⚠️ Visa Notes

- Malaysian citizens generally **don’t need a visa** for short stays in Europe  
- Starting in **2026**, Malaysian travelers will need to apply for **[ETIAS](https://travel-europe.europa.eu/en/etias)**

> Always check the latest official requirements before booking.

## 🎓 Budget Travel for Exchange Students: ESN × Ryanair

If you’re an exchange student in Europe, the **[ESN (Erasmus Student Network) card](https://www.esncard.org/ryanair)** is incredibly useful—especially for budget travel with **Ryanair**.

### ESN Card Benefits

- **10% off** on 4 single flights (or 2 return flights)  
- **Free 20kg checked luggage** on each of these flights  
- **Weekly travel offers** for Erasmus students  
- Tailored in-journey offers via the Ryanair app

### ⚠️ Important Notes

- Book tickets **at least 28 days in advance**  
- Valid for travel between **1 September 2025 – 15 June 2026**  
- Always refer to the **official ESN website** for updates

## 🔍 Travel Research & Preparation

I often scroll through **[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/)**, **[Tripadvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.com.my/)** and **[Red Note](https://www.xiaohongshu.com/explore)** to gather travel information. Before heading to a destination, I always look for reliable travel guides.

I usually watch **YouTube** videos and read travel articles or books written by bloggers. Through research, I figure out what to pack, what to save on, and tailor-make an alternative Plan B — just in case I get lost or run into bad weather.

> **In short:** research gives me freedom, not restrictions.

## 🏨 Accommodation

### Where I Usually Stay When Traveling Solo

When traveling solo in the EU, I usually prefer **budget-friendly hostels**. They’re affordable, social, and often located in convenient areas.

If I’m traveling with friends, family members, or parents, I usually turn to **[Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/)** for more space and unique stays.

### Platforms I Personally Use

- **[Booking.com](https://www.booking.com/index.en-gb.html?aid=397594&label=gog235jc-10CAEoggI46AdIM1gDaKEBiAEBmAEzuAEXyAEM2AED6AEB-AEBiAIBqAIBuAKZ3qXKBsACAdICJDhlNzM2MWI3LWFjYWQtNGNiNi05NzFmLTI3MDc2MTE2YjhlMtgCAeACAQ)** — mainly in the EU  
- **Trip.com** — mainly in China

These platforms clearly show price comparisons and offer a wide variety of accommodation types.

### Why I Prefer Booking.com

- Reliable customer service and issue resolution  
- Flexible payment options and cancellation policies  
- A large number of verified reviews and ratings  
- Quick hotel responses, especially for check-in or luggage storage

I’ve been using Booking.com for years and am currently a **Genius Level 3** member, which often means extra discounts and occasional free breakfast.

> **In short:** flexibility and reliability matter more than novelty.

## 🚆 Ground Transportation (Quick Note)

In the EU, the railway system is one of the best I’ve experienced. I often use **[Trainline](https://www.thetrainline.com/en-us)** or **[Omio](https://www.omio.com/)** to search schedules and compare prices.

With high-speed, regional, and sleeper trains—alongside well-developed urban transport systems—getting around Europe is efficient and accessible. E-bikes and scooters are also widely available in many cities.

## 📷 Camera Equipment

### The Camera I Use

I’ve been using the **Canon G7X Mark II** since 2022. It’s lightweight, compact, and easy to carry, while still producing high-quality photos.

Especially in winter, I love how convenient it is—I can quickly take it out for snapshots without dealing with lenses or bulky gear.

### ❄️ Shooting in Winter: A Small Tip

I recommend carrying **two pairs of gloves**:

- A thinner pair for shooting  
- A thicker pair to keep your hands warm between shots

You can wear the thicker gloves over the thinner ones and remove them only when needed.

---

### DSLR, iPhone, or Something Else?

I first considered buying this camera when I was 19. It suited my needs for daily photography and casual outings—especially when I briefly thought about starting YouTube vlogs😂.

If you’re aiming for professional DSLR-level quality, investing in a DSLR might make sense. For most travelers, however, an **iPhone is more than enough**, offering high resolution and powerful image processing.

Recent innovations—especially from brands like **DJI**—have made stable, professional-level shooting far more accessible to everyday users.

---

### 🧠 A Final Note on Buying Cameras

When purchasing any camera or action camera, consider both your **budget** and your **actual needs**.

Don’t buy a camera simply because it’s trending online. Some devices require heavy post-production work to achieve the results you see on social media.

If you’re not prepared for that process, the experience can quickly turn frustrating—and the camera may end up unused.

> **In short:** the best camera is the one you’ll actually use.
