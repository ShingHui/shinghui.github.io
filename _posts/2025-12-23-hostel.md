If you’ve already booked your flight ticket, I’m genuinely proud of you.
It may feel like a small step for you, but it’s a giant leap into a brand-new chapter of your life: your first solo trip.

What usually comes next is the big question:
**Where should I stay?**

For many first-time solo travellers, this part feels overwhelming—especially without a well-organised planner guiding the way. But honestly? The more you research and plan things yourself, the more rewarding the trip becomes. There’s something deeply satisfying about knowing you’ve figured it all out on your own.

If you prefer privacy and comfort, you can always book a hotel or private room via [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/) or [Booking.com](https://www.booking.com/index.en-gb.html?aid=397594&label=gog235jc-10CAEoggI46AdIM1gDaKEBiAEBmAEzuAEXyAEM2AED6AEB-AEBiAIBqAIBuAKZ3qXKBsACAdICJDhlNzM2MWI3LWFjYWQtNGNiNi05NzFmLTI3MDc2MTE2YjhlMtgCAeACAQ).
But if you want to meet people from all walks of life, connect with other solo travellers, and truly experience the social side of travel, **hostels** are worth trying at least once.

In my previous post about **travel resource**, I briefly touched on accommodation. This time, I want to go deeper—specifically on **how to choose hostels for your first solo trip** in Europe. (I haven’t tried this in China yet, so I won’t comment on that.)

Let’s start with the ultra-budget options—when you’re broke, curious, and open to human connection.

## Budget Options (Respect goes both ways)

### 🌸 Host A Sister

I love this platform. I’ve used it twice as a guest, and both experiences were genuinely heart-warming.

[Host A Sister](https://www.instagram.com/hostasister/) is a women-only community where members offer accommodation and support to fellow women travellers. The platform provides clear guidelines on how to write a post to find a host. You can also search by city name and message hosts directly—just be aware that some may no longer be active.

> **Basic courtesy matters. Being on time is non-negotiable.**

---

### 🛋 Couchsurfing

Here’s my honest take.

I tend to leave accommodation planning until about a week before arrival—or sometimes even later (please don’t copy this habit 😅). I also don’t enjoy spending excessive mental energy polishing profiles, reading hundreds of reviews, or coordinating back-and-forth messages with hosts.

On top of that, I strongly prefer staying close to city centres. For these reasons, **hostels suit me far better than Couchsurfing**.

Since last year, Couchsurfing has also introduced subscription fees.

Unless you’re someone who genuinely enjoys deep social interaction and spontaneity, I honestly don’t see why Couchsurfing should be your default option—especially just to save money. Staying overnight at a stranger’s home requires the right timing, location, and people. It’s not as simple as it sounds.

#### Things you should know about Couchsurfing

Hosts aren’t running hotels. They don’t offer fixed check-in times or 24-hour availability. They might not even be in the city when you arrive. This lack of certainty makes me uncomfortable—it can easily disrupt an entire travel plan.

**Safety matters**
<br> When evaluating a host, both the **quality and quantityof reviews**  are critical.

> For solo female travellers, prioritise hosts who are **women, couples, or families with children**. These setups tend to offer relatively more security.

#### How far in advance should you prepare?

Finding a suitable Couchsurfing host can take **weeks—or even over a month**. Sometimes, you won’t find one at all. Your profile, timing, destination, and luck all play a role.

In short: you need to start early.
(Which, honestly, is why this isn’t my thing😜.)

### Who is Couchsurfing / Host A Sister for?

Think of it this way:
You’re staying at a friend’s home—not a free hotel.

You wouldn’t just arrive, shower, sleep, and leave early the next morning without interaction. That would be rude and unfair. Your host is offering kindness, time, and trust. Respect that.

No one owes you accommodation.
No one is responsible for meeting your expectations.

These platforms are built on **trust and mutual respect**. They can be safe, meaningful, and culturally enriching—but they are not for everyone. And that’s okay.

> **Always have a backup plan** in case a host cancels.

## Finding Hostels & Hotels
### 🏨 Hostelworld

[Hostelworld](https://www.hostelworld.com/?source=ppc_gooads_brand_dsk_search_brd_en_row&network=g&campaign_id=13461949562&adgroup_id=130259537424&criteria_id=kwd-137381844&creative_id=594756953728&location_physical_id=1029496&location_interest_id=&adposition=&uniqueclickID=13934523597972709410&sub_keyword=hostelworld&sub_ad=e&sub_publisher=ADW&gclsrc=aw.ds&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=13461949562&gbraid=0AAAAAD9QXQbTj9mkh-k-sJhQBlNO1c1BZ&gclid=CjwKCAiAmKnKBhBrEiwAaqAnZwz4swnkyuOtLi66Om8yfn8vyIp1_4ZMa8amUuO5gm9ui85ZJfGXahoCWJAQAvD_BwE) is one of the industry standards for budget accommodation. It’s been around for decades, offers a wide range of options, and generally features honest reviews. As many travellers suggest, aim for places rated **9.0 or above**.

However, I’ve seen multiple Reddit reviews mentioning last-minute cancellations where Hostelworld took no responsibility.

Personally, I’ve rarely used Hostelworld in Europe.

I’ve been using **Booking.com** for years, and my Genius Level 3 status often gives me discounts or promotions. My advice? **Use the platform you’re already comfortable with.**

## 🤯 Which One Should You Choose?(Quick Guide)
> *If you’re short on time, here’s a quick comparison to help you decide.*

| Type             | Safety Level | Planning Stress | Social Interaction | My Take |
|------------------|--------------|------------------|--------------------|---------|
| **Host A Sister**| ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆        | Medium           | Medium–High        | Warm but situational |
| **Couchsurfing** | ⭐⭐⭐☆☆        | High             | High               | Not my preference |
| **Hostel/Hotel** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆        | Low              | Optional           | Most reliable |

## 🧠Final thoughts

I don’t Couchsurf. It makes me uneasy—if a host cancels last minute, you’re forced to book expensive accommodation under pressure. You’re also staying in an unfamiliar home, in an unfamiliar country, with someone who holds all the local knowledge. That power imbalance doesn’t sit well with me.

I do stay in hostels, often in female dorms.I’ve stayed in over 10 hostels in the EU, and I’ve never had anything stolen.

Everyone travels differently. <br>
This is simply what works for me.

## Hostels I Stayed In (Winter 2024–25)

Below are some hostels I personally stayed in during Winter 2024–25.

### My booking rule of thumb  
I always cross-check reviews across multiple platforms, including **Booking.com, Agoda, and Google Maps**. There’s no single “best” booking site — **patterns matter more than platforms**.

### 🔎 What I prioritise
1. **Cleanliness & bathrooms**  
2. **Location** (close to the city centre / convenient transportation)  
3. **Luggage storage availability**

I’m generally not too demanding when it comes to hostels.  
As long as the place is clean, I’m comfortable staying in **4–6 bed dorms**.

> **Extra notes:**  
> - Prices can vary significantly between **winter and summer seasons**.  
> - If you’re sensitive to **noise, hygiene, luggage storage, ventilation, or air conditioning**, always read recent reviews carefully.  
> - Make good use of **review filters** — they save a lot of time and frustration.
